  <tr>
    <td style="width:5%"></td>
    <td>The purpose of the ontology is to model and describe an Ishikawa diagram as visual artifact, its encoded information, and its creation process.</td>

    <td><b>Scope</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="width:5%"></td>
    <td>The scope of this ontology is limited to Ishikawa diagrams and their identified best practices. Other tools for root cause analysis are not in scope of the ontology, but can be ontologically aligned. The same also applies for the multitude of techniques which can be used for Ishikawa diagramming, but are not explicitly contained in the core ontology.</td>

    Providing explicit description of an Ishikawa diagram including tacit knowledge <br>
    Providing extensive information of the Ishikawa diagram creation process to conclude its completeness (e.g. in regard to contribution of all domain experts). <br>
    Linking responsibilities to factors and their cause-effect relationships to easier formulate problem-resolving actions.
